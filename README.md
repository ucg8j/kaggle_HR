This repo contains code for a binary classification problem with Python's machine learning library [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/). 

**Aim**: Create a model that predicts who is going to leave the organisation next. Commonly known as churn modelling.

To follow along, I breakdown each piece of the coding journey in [this blog post](http://lukesingham.com/whos-going-to-leave-next/).
